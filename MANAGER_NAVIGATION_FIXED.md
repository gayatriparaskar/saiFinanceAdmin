# Manager Navigation - FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified:
When clicking "Expenses" in the manager navbar, it was redirecting to `/expenses` (admin expense page) instead of `/manager-dashboard/expenses` (manager expense page).

## Root Cause:
The ManagerNavbar navigation items had the wrong path for the Expenses link.

## Solution Applied:
**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard/ManagerDashboard/ManagerNavbar.jsx`

### **Before (incorrect):**
```javascript
const navigationItems = [
  { name: t("Home"), path: "/manager-dashboard" },
  { name: t("Loan Account"), path: "/manager-dashboard/loan-account" },
  { name: t("Overdue Loans"), path: "/manager-dashboard/overdue-loans" },
  { name: t("Saving Account"), path: "/manager-dashboard/saving-account" },
  { name: t("Officer Controls"), path: "/manager-dashboard/officer" },
  { name: t("Expenses"), path: "/expenses" },  // ❌ Wrong path
  { name: t("Reports"), path: "/manager-dashboard/reports" }
];
```

### **After (fixed):**
```javascript
const navigationItems = [
  { name: t("Home"), path: "/manager-dashboard" },
  { name: t("Loan Account"), path: "/manager-dashboard/loan-account" },
  { name: t("Overdue Loans"), path: "/manager-dashboard/overdue-loans" },
  { name: t("Saving Account"), path: "/manager-dashboard/saving-account" },
  { name: t("Officer Controls"), path: "/manager-dashboard/officer" },
  { name: t("Expenses"), path: "/manager-dashboard/expenses" },  // ✅ Correct path
  { name: t("Reports"), path: "/manager-dashboard/reports" }
];
```

## **Current Route Structure:**

| Route | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `/manager-dashboard/expenses` | `ManagerExpensePage` | ✅ **Manager expense management** |
| `/expenses` | `ExpenseManagement` | ✅ **Admin expense management** |
| `/accountant-expenses` | `AccountantExpensePage` | ✅ **Accountant expense management** |

## **Result:**
- ✅ **Manager navbar** now correctly points to `/manager-dashboard/expenses`
- ✅ **Manager expense page** will load with ManagerExpensePage
- ✅ **Manager-specific features** will be available
- ✅ **Proper navigation** within manager dashboard

Now when you click "Expenses" in the manager navbar, it will correctly navigate to the manager expense page at `/manager-dashboard/expenses`!
