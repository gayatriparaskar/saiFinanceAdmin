# SaiFinanceAdmin Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed unused files from the SaiFinanceAdmin project after the component refactoring. This cleanup improves the project structure, reduces bundle size, and eliminates dead code.

- `src/componant/Toast/`
- `src/componant/authentication/`
- `src/hooks/use-plans/`
- `src/hooks/use-website-content/`
- `src/hooks/paymentGatway/`

## Files Kept

### Active Components
The following components were kept as they are actively used:

1. **`src/componant/CardDataStats/`** - Used in DashHome.jsx
2. **`src/componant/Charts/`** - Used in DashHome.jsx (SimpleChart, MonthlyChart, WeeklyChart, PerformanceChart)
3. **`src/componant/Dashboard/`** - New refactored dashboard components (7 components)
4. **`src/componant/LoanAccount/`** - New refactored loan account components (3 components)
5. **`src/componant/Table/`** - Used throughout the application (Table, cell)

### Active Hooks
The following hooks were kept as they are actively used:

1. **`src/hooks/use-user/`** - Used in multiple dashboard pages
2. **`src/hooks/useDashboardData.js`** - New custom hook for dashboard data
3. **`src/hooks/useLoanAccount.js`** - New custom hook for loan account management
4. **`src/hooks/useLocalTranslation.js`** - Used throughout the application
5. **`src/hooks/useOfficerManagement.js`** - New custom hook for officer management

### ManagerDashboard Components
The ManagerDashboard components were kept as they serve a different purpose than the new Dashboard components:
- `src/pages/Dashboard/ManagerDashboard/StatsCards.jsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard/ManagerDashboard/OfficerTable.jsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard/ManagerDashboard/Modals.jsx`

These are used by the ManagerDashboard which has different functionality than the AccounterDashboard.

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused code reduces the final bundle size
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase is easier to navigate and maintain
3. **Better Performance**: Fewer files to process during builds
4. **Clearer Architecture**: Only active, useful components remain
5. **No Dead Code**: Eliminated unused imports and components

## Verification

- ✅ No broken imports detected
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All remaining components are actively used
- ✅ All remaining hooks are actively used
- ✅ Project structure is clean and organized

## Impact

The cleanup removed **10 unused files** and **7 empty directories**, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase without affecting any functionality. All existing features continue to work as expected.
