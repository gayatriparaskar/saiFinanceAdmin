2. **Online Mode**: Calls API to delete expense
3. **Demo Mode**: Removes from local state immediately
4. **Auto-refresh**: Refreshes expense list after deletion

        ? { ...exp, status: 'approved' }
        : exp
    ));
    return;
  }
  
  // Real API call

  if (connectionStatus === 'offline') {
    setExpenses(prev => prev.filter(exp => exp._id !== expense._id));
    return;
  }
  
  // Real API call
